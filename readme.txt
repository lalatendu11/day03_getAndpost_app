1. This Django code defines several views for handling input and performing addition.
 Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

2. getInput: This view renders a template named "getinput.html".
   It's likely used to display a form for users to input numbers.

3. postInput: This view renders a template named "postinput.html".
   It's probably another form for input, but it's designed to handle POST requests.

4. add: This view handles addition. It first checks whether the request
    method is POST or not. If it's POST, it retrieves the values of "t1" and "t2" from
    the POST request (assuming these are input fields from a form), converts them to integers,
    adds them, and returns an HTTP response displaying the sum. If the request method is
    not POST (presumably it's GET), it retrieves the values of "t1" and "t2" from the GET request,
    performs the addition similarly, and returns the sum.

Here's a quick rundown of the flow:

If the request method is POST, it retrieves the values from the POST dictionary and performs addition.
If the request method is not POST (assuming it's GET), it retrieves the values from the GET dictionary
and performs addition.

In Django, just like in web development in general, the HTTP methods GET and POST serve different
purposes:

GET: This method is used for retrieving data from the server. When you submit a form with
method="get" in HTML, or when you make a simple request via a link or URL, you're typically
using the GET method. In Django, when you handle a GET request in a view, you often use it to
render a template with some initial data or to retrieve resources without modifying the server's state.

POST: This method is used for sending data to the server to be processed or stored.
 When you submit a form with method="post" in HTML, the form data is sent in the body of the request,
 rather than as part of the URL like with GET requests. In Django, when you handle a POST request
 in a view, you often use it to process form submissions, such as user registrations, login forms,
 or any other data submission forms.

Here are some key differences between GET and POST requests in Django:

Security: GET requests expose submitted data in the URL, which can be seen in the
browser's address bar and in server logs. This makes them unsuitable for sensitive data
such as passwords. POST requests, on the other hand, send data in the request body, making
them more secure for transmitting sensitive information.

Data Size: GET requests have limitations on the amount of data that can be sent, as
data is appended to the URL. This limit varies across browsers and servers but is generally
lower than POST requests, which can handle larger data payloads as they send data in the request body.

Idempotent vs Non-idempotent: GET requests are considered idempotent, meaning they should not
have any side effects on the server (i.e., they can be repeated without causing different results).
POST requests, on the other hand, are non-idempotent, as they typically result in data being stored
or modified on the server, and repeating the same request could lead to unintended
consequences (e.g., duplicate submissions).

In Django, views can handle both GET and POST requests. Depending on the method used,
you can access submitted data through request.GET or request.POST dictionaries respectively.
Django provides shortcuts and utilities to simplify handling form submissions and processing data
from both methods.
